A library of numerical tools that broadly fit into the following categoties.
- Univariate and bivariate statistics in addition to statistical testign routines.
- Integration and time stepping and sequencing routines.
- Matrix routines, Fourier transform and N-dimensional interpolation.
- Root finding and mininisation routines including N-dimensional simplex algorithm.
- Utility tools for housekeeping and simple mathematical functions for testing 
  and running the numerical routines.
